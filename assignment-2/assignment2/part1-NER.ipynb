    "You might have seen some results from computer vision where the individual neurons learn to detect edges, shapes, or even [cat faces](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html). We're going to do the same for language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that each \"neuron\" is essentially a logistic regression unit, with weights corresponding to rows of the corresponding matrix. So, if we have a hidden layer of dimension 100, then we can think of our matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{100 x 150}$ as representing 100 hidden neurons each with weights `W[i,:]` and bias `b1[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a): Hidden Layer, Center Word\n",
    "For now, let's just look at the center word, and ignore the rest of the window. This corresponds to columns `W[:,50:100]`, although this could change if you altered the window size for your model. For each neuron, find the top 10 words that it responds to, as measured by the dot product between `W[i,50:100]` and `L[j]`. Use the provided code to print these words and their scores for 5 neurons of your choice. In your writeup, briefly describe what you notice here.\n",
